# 1. Write a program that uses variables to store a first and last name, then prints the full name in one line using string concatenation (the + operator).
# first_name = "grace"
# last_name = "joh"
# puts first_name + " " + last_name

# 2. Write a program that uses variables to store a first and last name, then prints the full name in one line using string interpolation (the #{} operator).
# first_name = "grace"
# last_name = "joh"
# p "#{first_name} #{last_name}"

# 3. Write a program that asks the user to input a word. If the word is "marco", print "polo".
# puts "enter a word: "
# word = gets.chomp
# if word == "marco"
#   puts "polo"
# end

# 4. Write a program that uses variables to store three different colors, then prints out a sentence using the colors with string concatenation (the + operator).
# x = "green"
# y = "blue"
# z = "red"
# p x + " " + x + " " + z
# p "my favorite colors are " + x + ", " + y + ", and " + z + "."

# x = "green"
# y = "blue"
# z = "red"
# p "my favorite colors are #{x}, #{y}, and #{z}."

# 6. Write a program that asks the user to enter a name. If the name is not "Santa", print "You're not Santa."
# p "enter a name: "
# name = gets.chomp
# if name == "Santa"
#   p "you're not santa!!!"
# end

# 7. Write a program that uses variables to store a book's title and author, then prints out a sentence using that information with string concatenation (the + operator).
# book_title = "harry potter"
# author = "grace"
# p "my favorite book is called " + book_title + " by " + author + "."

# 8. Write a program that uses variables to store a book's title and author, then prints out a sentence using that information with string interpolation (the #{} operator).
# book_title = "harry potter"
# author = "grace"
# p "my favorie book is called #{book_title} by #{author}."

# 9. Write a program that asks the user to enter a password. If the password is "Joshua", the program responds "Shall we play a game?". For any other password, the program responds "Access denied"
# puts "enter a password: "
# password = gets.chomp
# if password == "Joshua"
#   p "Shall we play a game?"
# else
#   p "Access denied"

# 10. Write a program that uses variables to store the names of three cities, then prints out a sentence using that information with string concatenation (the + operator).
city1 = "new york"
city2 = "chicago"
city3 = "seoul"
p "my cities are " + city1 + ", " + city2 + ", " + city3 + "."
