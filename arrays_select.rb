#  1. Start with an array of numbers and create a new array with only the numbers less than 20.
#     For example, [2, 32, 80, 18, 12, 3] becomes [2, 18, 12, 3].
# numbers = [2, 32, 80, 18, 12, 3]
# new_array = []
# index = 0
# while index < numbers.length
#   if numbers[index] < 20
#     new_array << numbers[index]
#   end
#   index += 1
# end
# p new_array

#  2. Start with an array of strings and create a new array with only the strings that start with the letter "w".
#     For example, ["winner", "winner", "chicken", "dinner"] becomes ["winner", "winner"].
# arrays = ["winner", "winner", "chicken", "dinner"]

#  3. Start with an array of hashes and create a new array with only the hashes with prices greater than 5 (from the :price key).
#     For example, [{name: "chair", price: 100}, {name: "pencil", price: 1}, {name: "book", price: 4}] becomes [{name: "chair", price: 100}].
# items = [{ name: "chair", price: 100 }, { name: "pencil", price: 1 }, { name: "book", price: 4 }]

#  4. Start with an array of numbers and create a new array with only the even numbers.
#     For example, [2, 4, 5, 1, 8, 9, 7] becomes [2, 4, 8].
# numbers = [2, 4, 5, 1, 8, 9, 7]

#  5. Start with an array of strings and create a new array with only the strings shorter than 4 letters.
#     For example, ["a", "man", "a", "plan", "a", "canal", "panama"] becomes ["a", "man", "a", "a"].
# strings = ["a", "man", "a", "plan", "a", "canal", "panama"]

#  6. Start with an array of hashes and create a new array with only the hashes with names shorter than 6 letters (from the :name key).
#     For example, [{name: "chair", price: 100}, {name: "pencil", price: 1}, {name: "book", price: 4}] becomes [{name: "chair", price: 100}, {name: "book", price: 4}].
# arrays = [{ name: "chair", price: 100 }, { name: "pencil", price: 1 }, { name: "book", price: 4 }]

#  7.Start with an array of numbers and create a new array with only the numbers greater than or equal to 23.
#     For example, [8, 23, 0, 44, 1980, 3] becomes [23, 44, 1980].
# arrays = [8, 23, 0, 44, 1980, 3]

#  8. Start with an array of strings and create a new array with only the strings that don't start with the letter "b".
#     For example, ["big", "little", "good", "bad"] becomes ["little", "good"].
# arrays = ["big", "little", "good", "bad"]

#  9. Start with an array of hashes and create a new array with only the hashes with prices less than 10 (from the :price key).
#     For example, [{name: "chair", price: 100}, {name: "pencil", price: 1}, {name: "book", price: 4}] becomes [{name: "pencil", price: 1}, {name: "book", price: 4}].
# arrays = [{ name: "chair", price: 100 }, { name: "pencil", price: 1 }, { name: "book", price: 4 }]

# 10. Start with an array of numbers and create a new array with only the odd numbers.
#     For example, [2, 4, 5, 1, 8, 9, 7] becomes [5, 1, 9, 7].
# arrays = [2, 4, 5, 1, 8, 9, 7]
