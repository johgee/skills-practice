# 1. Write a program that asks the user to enter a word, then prints that word with all capital letters.
# puts "enter a word: "
# word = gets.chomp
# puts word.upcase

# 2. Write a program that asks the user to enter a number, then prints "That's a big number" if the number is greater than 100.
# puts "enter a number: "
# number = gets.chomp
# if number > 100
#   puts "that's a big number!!!"
# end

# 3. Write a program that asks the user to enter two numbers, then prints the numbers added together.
# puts "enter a number: "
# number = gets.chomp
# puts "enter another_number: "
# another_number = gets.chomp
# p number.to_i + another_number.to_i

# 4. Write a program that asks the user to enter a word, then prints that word in reverse order.
# puts "enter a word: "
# word = gets.chomp
# puts word.reverse

# 5. Write a program that asks the user to enter a number, then prints the number times 10.
# puts "enter a number: "
# number = gets.chomp
# puts number.to_i * 10

# 6. Write a program that asks the user to enter two words, then prints both words on the same line in all capital letters.
# puts "enter a word: "
# word = gets.chomp
# puts "enter another_word: "
# another_word = gets.chomp
# puts "#{word.upcase} #{another_word.upcase}"

# 7. Write a program that asks the user to enter a word, then prints the number of letters in the word.
# puts "enter a word: "
# word = gets.chomp
# puts word.length

# 8. Write a program that asks the user to enter a number, then prints "That's a negative number" if the number is less than 0.
# puts "enter a number: "
# number = gets.chomp
# if number.to_i < 0
#   puts "that's a negative number!"
# end

# 9. Write a program that asks the user to enter two numbers, then prints the two numbers multiplied together.
# puts "enter a number: "
# number = gets.chomp
# puts "enter another_number: "
# another_number = gets.chomp
# puts number.to_i * another_number.to_i

# 10. Write a program that asks the user to enter a word, then prints "That's a long word" if the word has more than 5 letters.
puts "enter a word: "
word = gets.chomp
if word.length > 5
  puts "that's a long word!"
